<h2>Train DeepLabv3 with ResNet50 as a backbone on PascalVOC dataset:</h2>
<h3>In this project i trained a  DeepLabv3 with ResNet50 as a backbone on PascalVOC dataset.</h3>
<h3>I used some pre-trained codes on GitHub at the address [https://github.com/pytorch/vision], which belongs to PyTorch, to train the model on this dataset. I continued training for 7 epochs and achieved an mIOU of 50.4, although this value would increase if I continued training.</h3>
